You are a FMM student. Today is exam day! NO WAY!!!
You will be tested on each of the 6 basic courses in the order of Math, English, Science, Business, PhysEd, and Art.
You will not be able to skip any course, and must pass the first course to allow access to the next course.
In each round, you will be required to answer 6 trivia questions and if you get at least 4 out of them right, you pass that course.
Each time you pass a course, you will obtain an "item", which is a hint for the final riddle or simply a motivation quote.
Once you fail any course it is game over.
You can restart but it will start from the first class (Math) again, and the years you take to graduate will increment by 1.
Be careful, once you press the "give up" button you will become a permanent student!
The "escape" button brings you to the riddle page, where you will get an unlimited number of tries to input the answer.
After you pass all courses and answer the final riddle, you will finally be able to escape from FMM!
